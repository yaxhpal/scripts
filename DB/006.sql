The Kaiser-i-Hind is en route to Bombay. In Cabin D38, Viva Holloway, an inexperienced chaperone, is beginning to feel as though she\'s made a mistake. Her advert in The Lady has resulted in three unsettling young charges to be escorted to India. Rose, a beautiful, dangerously naive English girl, is about to be married to the cavalry officer she has met a handful of times. Victoria, her bridesmaid, is determined to lose her virginity en route before finding a husband of her own. And overshadowing all three, the dangerously malevolent presence of Guy Glover. But nothing frightens Viva as much as her real reasons for the voyage: firstly to lead an independent life, husband-less life as a writer, and secondly, to confront her own explosive past. Three potential Memsahibs with a multitude of reasons for leaving their homeland - but the cargo of hopes and secrets they carry can do little to prepare them for what lies ahead in India. From the parties of the wealthy Bombay socialites, to the ragged orphans on Tamarind Stree, EAST OF THE SUN is an utterly engaging novel that will captivate readers everywhere.  aClassic fiction (pre c 1945)  aFiction  aGhosts  aHomesick  aSecrets  aFICbUNDEF  w2011-08-04pDL131538r2014-01-2340006F_GRE9924787bDLm510oF GREd2011-08-048Audiobooks70yBKs2013-02-19l11aDL  c406207d406207',marcxml='<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<record\n    xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n    xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/schema/MARC21slim.xsd\"\n    xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim\">\n\n  <leader>01901nam a2200253Ia 4500</leader>\n  <controlfield tag=\"001\">DLABK000005</controlfield>\n  <controlfield tag=\"008\">110719s9999    xx            000 0 und d</controlfield>\n  <datafield tag=\"020\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"a\">1409104540</subfield>\n  </datafield>\n  <datafield tag=\"082\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"a\">F GRE</subfield>\n  </datafield>\n  <datafield tag=\"100\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"a\">Gregson, Julia</subfield>\n  </datafield>\n  <datafield tag=\"245\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"a\">East of the sun</subfield>\n    <subfield code=\"c\">Julia Gregson</subfield>\n  </datafield>\n  <datafield tag=\"250\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"a\">Abridged edition</subfield>\n  </datafield>\n  <datafield tag=\"260\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"a\">United Kingdom</subfield>\n    <subfield code=\"b\">Orion Publishing Co</subfield>\n    <subfield code=\"c\">17/07/2008</subfield>\n  </datafield>\n  <datafield tag=\"300\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"b\">CD-AUDIO</subfield>\n  </datafield>\n  <datafield tag=\"500\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"a\">Winner of Romantic Novel of the Year Award 2009.</subfield>\n  </datafield>\n  <datafield tag=\"505\" ind1=\" \" ind2=\" \">\n    <subfield code=\"a\">Autumn 1928.
